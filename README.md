# One in a Million
 
Here is a list of about one million Ethereum accounts with balances ranging from 1 to 300,000.  
This list is the result when the following steps are executed:  
1. Take a snapshot of Ethereum balances at blocks 1, 10, 100, 1k, 10k, 100k, 1m, 10m, sum it up by address.  
2. Remove accounts with less than 1 ETH total.  
3. Cap accounts with big balances to 300,000 ETH.  
4. Remove addresses that are smart contracts.  

Decimals: 6  
Count: 1,031,203 addresses  
Min: 1.000000 ETH  
Cap: 300,000.000000 ETH
